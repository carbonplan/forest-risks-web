Set to true to deduplicate points when filtering. This addresses mapbox's
caveat about duplication in their docs on queryRenderedFeatures and
querySourceFeatures. (https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/api/map/#map).

Deduping causes a significant performance hit when the number of points in the
filter region is large. So we should turn it on occassionally just to
see if duplication is actually happening. If it is, there will be a message in
the console.

Based on initial testing, it looks like querySourceFeatures does
duplicate points, but queryRenderedFeatures does not.
